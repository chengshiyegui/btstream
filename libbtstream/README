libbtstream is a C++ library that implements a BitTorrent client and provides
a simple API to read downloaded pieces sequentially, allowing the development 
of P2P multimedia streaming software. It implements different piece selection
algorithms and allows the implementation of new BitTorrent extensions.

For more information, see the project's page:

To build with GNU Automake, just follow the standard steps (more details on
the `INSTALL` file):

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You may need to run the last step as a super user (sudo).
