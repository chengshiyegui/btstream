BTStreamSrc is a GStreamer plugin that uses libbtstream to define a source 
element that can be used to build multimedia streaming applications with the
GStreamer framework.

For more information, see the project's page:

    http://code.google.com/p/btstream

To build with GNU Automake, just follow the standard steps (more details on
the `INSTALL` file):

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You may need to run the last step as a super user (sudo).
